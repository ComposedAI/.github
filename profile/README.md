## Introduction

A Toolkit of single purpose libraries that can be composed together to build Generative AI solutions

### Features

* Minimal Individual Libraries - Each library is a single purpose library with minimal to no external dependencies
* Toolkit - Each library is designed to be used independently or together for a complete GenAI stack
* Node and TypeScript - The entire tookit is designed to run on NodeJS because I am a fan of Node and TS
